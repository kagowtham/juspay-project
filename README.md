# Rotating Cube wireframe: 

  Draw a 3D Cube wireframe and rotate it along ​the​ ax​es​ that passes through its center. The rotating object should decelerate at a rate of ‘X’ degrees/sec​^​2 before it comes to a standstill.
  The object should respond as follows to the following user inputs
   Swipe
  ​/Drag​
  : Accelerates or decelerates the rotating object as per the difference in velocity between
​ rotation and swipe with the friction factor Y.
  Touch
​ /Click​
  generates friction that should decelerate the rotation further by a Y (friction factor)
